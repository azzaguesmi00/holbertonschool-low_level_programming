Variadic Functions:
Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. These functions are designed to handle an unspecified number of parameters during the function call. Languages like C and C++ provide mechanisms, such as macros in the <stdarg.h> header (in C) or the std::initializer_list (in C++), to work with variadic functions.
