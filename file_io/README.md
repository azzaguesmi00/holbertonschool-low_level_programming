"File I/O" stands for File Input/Output, and it refers to the operations performed on files, such as reading from or writing to files. File I/O is a fundamental aspect of many computer programs that need to interact with external files for data storage or retrieval.

In the context of programming, especially in languages like C, C++, and Python, file I/O typically involves using functions or methods to open, read, write, and close files. Some common operations in file I/O include:

Opening a File: Use functions like open() in C or open() method in Python to open a file for reading, writing, or both.

Reading from a File: Use functions like fread() in C or methods like read() in Python to read data from a file.

Writing to a File: Use functions like fwrite() in C or methods like write() in Python to write data to a file.

Closing a File: Use functions like close() in C or methods like close() in Python to close an opened file.
